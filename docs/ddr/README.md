# Design Decision Records

Source: _Capstone Practice — Movie Reservation System — Design Decision Records_,
13–14 Aug 2026. All records are **Accepted**.

Each record has five parts: what forced the decision, what was decided, why, what it costs,
and what would make it worth revisiting.

## ADR or DDR?

An **ADR** ([../adr](../adr/README.md)) records a decision that shapes the whole system and
would be expensive to change. A **DDR** records a decision made while implementing one — a
value you could change this afternoon. ADR-007 chose to lock seats with a hold and a database
constraint; DDR-001 decides the hold lasts ten minutes. **No decision appears in both
documents.**

## Open divergences from the code

One record currently disagrees with what is committed. It is flagged in a blockquote at the
foot of its record; the summary lives in [decisions-vs-code.md](../decisions-vs-code.md).

| Record  | Disagreement                                                |
| ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| DDR-007 | Record rejects `forbidNonWhitelisted`; the pipe enables it. |

## Adding a record

Copy [`_template.md`](_template.md) to `NNNN-kebab-title.md` using the next unused number,
fill it in, name the ADR it implements, and add a row to the index above. The
`/decision-record` skill does this for you.
