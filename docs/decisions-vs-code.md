# Decisions vs. code

What the records say against what is committed on this branch. Keep this table honest — an
ADR that quietly disagrees with the code is worse than no ADR.

Last checked: 03 Sep 2026, on `chore/setup-monorepo` (the API moved to `apps/api` and the Expo
client joined as `apps/mobile`; API behaviour unchanged).

> **Paths in this table are workspace-relative.** Everything that was at the repository root
> before ADR-015 now sits under `apps/api/`.

Each is also flagged in a blockquote at the foot of its own record. Resolve them either way —
change the code, or supersede the record — but do not leave them silently disagreeing.

## Not yet built

Records that are accepted but have no code behind them yet. This is expected; the branch is
the application skeleton over a designed schema.

| ------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| —      | `DELETE /seat-holds/:id` (voluntary release, `docs/api/README.md`) — the only endpoint left undocumented as _Planned_ |

## Notes

- **Ownership checks (ADR-006, BR-34).** Wired up for real in the Users module (DDR-012), the
  Movies/Genres module (DDR-014), and now Reservations end to end: `SeatHoldsController`
  (`POST /showtimes/:id/hold`) and `ReservationsController` (`POST /reservations`,
  `GET /reservations/:id`, `POST /reservations/:id/cancel`) all take `userId`/`currentUser`
  from `@CurrentUser()`, never the request body. `GET /reservations/:id` is owner-or-admin;
  `POST /reservations/:id/cancel` is deliberately owner-only, matching
  `docs/api/README.md`'s "Auth: Bearer, owner" (no admin override) for that one route. Only
  `DELETE /seat-holds/:id` remains without an ownership check, since it doesn't exist yet.
- **ADR-009 is now fully built.** The 60-second seat-hold sweep (`SeatHoldSweepService`)
  flips expired `held` rows to `expired` (BR-27); `findSeatOccupancyRows`'s `held_until > NOW()`
  join condition stays regardless — a hold can still be up to a minute stale before the next
  sweep tick, and the read path was always meant to be correct independent of the sweep having
  run. `ReservationCompletionSweepService` now covers the 15-minute half, flipping `CONFIRMED`
  reservations to `COMPLETED` once their showtime has finished.
- **Nothing flips `showtimes.status` from `scheduled`/`active` to `completed` as real time
  passes** — `ShowtimesService`'s `ALLOWED_TRANSITIONS` only fires on an admin `PATCH`. Both
  `ReservationCompletionSweepService` (has this showtime finished?) and
  `ReservationsService.cancel` (BR-29 — has it started?) therefore compute the answer from
  `show_date`/`show_time`/`end_time` directly via two new `time.util.ts` helpers
  (`dateTimeToInstant`, `showtimeEndInstant`), rather than trusting `showtime.status`. Revisit
  if a job is ever added to advance `showtime.status` itself — at that point the two sources of
  truth should be reconciled rather than left to agree by construction.
- **Judgment call: reservation cancellation cascades to its tickets.** ADR-008/BR-24 mandate
  `CONFIRMED → CANCELLED` on the reservation and, as the only way to actually free the seats,
  `CONFIRMED → RELEASED` on its `seat_holds` (BR-17's index depends on it). Neither ADR-008 nor
  `business-rules.md`'s "State machine guards" table says anything about `tickets.status` on
  cancellation — `ReservationsService.cancel` flips `VALID → CANCELLED` there too, since leaving
  tickets permanently `valid` under a cancelled reservation makes BR-10's `cancelled` value dead
  code, and DDR-010's revenue query already filters on `reservation.status` alone so this has no
  effect on revenue correctness either way. Revisit if a future record says otherwise.
- **The seed's `DDR-009` row is gone from "Not yet built".** The seed exists at
  `apps/api/src/database/seed/` and runs on application bootstrap; the old entry was stale.
- **Container images: one `production` target promoted through staging and production.**
  `apps/api/Dockerfile` has two targets — `development` (hot reload, full deps, used via the
  auto-merged `docker-compose.override.yml`) and `production` (lean, compiled, non-root).
  Staging and production intentionally build and run the _same_ `production` image, differing
  only by env vars/secrets supplied at deploy time (`docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up`
  with an environment-specific `--env-file`), not by separate Dockerfile targets — this is the
  basis the future CI/CD pipeline should build on rather than re-deciding.
- **Refresh token reuse detection.** ADR-005/BR-32 are satisfied by rotation + revocation.
  Detecting _reuse_ of an already-revoked token as a theft signal (and revoking the rest of
  that user's sessions in response) was considered and deliberately deferred — it needs a
  schema change (tracking token lineage) beyond what either record asks for.
- **Mobile auth is migrating off Supabase.** `apps/mobile` sign in, sign up, session
  bootstrap and sign out now call `@movea/api` (`/auth/register|login|refresh|logout|me`)
  via `apps/mobile/src/services/api/client.ts`; the token pair is persisted in
  `secureStorage`. OAuth (Google/Facebook) and the password-reset screens were removed or
  hidden — the API has no equivalent yet (`PATCH /users/me/password` exists for change, not
  reset). Movies, booking, wallet, tickets and profile still read Supabase directly, so
  `apps/mobile/src/services/supabase/client.ts` stays until those features migrate; until
  then `useAuthStore().user.id` is an `@movea/api` id that will not match Supabase rows.

## Keeping this current

Re-check when a module lands, and when a record is added or superseded. The
`/decision-record` skill reminds you to update this file.
