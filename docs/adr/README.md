# Architecture Decision Records

Source: _Capstone Practice — Movie Reservation System — Architecture Decision Records_,
12–14 Aug 2026. All records are **Accepted**.

## ADR or DDR?

An **ADR** records a decision that shapes the whole system and would be expensive to
change — the framework, the database, the locking strategy. A **DDR**
([../ddr](../ddr/README.md)) records a decision made while implementing one: a specific
value, a step order, a response shape. The test is how hard it would be to reverse.

ADR-007 chose to lock seats with a hold and a database constraint; DDR-001 decides the hold
lasts ten minutes. **No decision appears in both documents.**

## Numbering policy

Records are numbered in the order the decisions were taken, not grouped by subject. This log
is **append-only**: existing records are never renumbered, because other documents, commit
messages and review comments refer to them by number. A decision that is later reversed is
marked `Superseded` and a new record is added, rather than the original being edited or
removed.

## Earlier proposal revisions

An earlier revision of the proposal described a microservices edition — RabbitMQ, Clerk,
Stripe, seven deployables, thirty-one ADRs. It is **not** the design being built and its
numbering does not resolve against this log. It is not carried in this repository; the
records above are the current, authoritative set and are the ones the
[database design](../database/README.md) cites.

## Adding a record

Copy [`_template.md`](_template.md) to `NNNN-kebab-title.md` using the next unused number,
fill it in, and add a row to the index above. The `/decision-record` skill does this for you.
